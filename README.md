This is a small Node.js script that runs multiple Lighthouse audits on a single URL and shows you the average performance results. If you want, it can export a CSV file with all the numbers.

# How It Works
Runs Lighthouse a bunch of times in a row (or all at once in parallelâ€”though that can get noisy).

Saves each run's JSON report 

Logs the results (performance scores, LCP, TBT, CLS) for each run, plus the average for all runs.

(Optional) Creates a summary.csv if you want a quick reference without digging through JSON.

# Getting Started
Clone or Download this project.

Install dependencies:

`npm install`

Make sure you have Node.js v18+ and Chrome installed.

# Usage
##  Basic Command

`node lh-udits.js --url https://example.com --iterations 3`

- Audits https://example.com 3 times.

- Saves report-run-1.json, report-run-2.json, report-run-3.json.

- Shows a breakdown of each run, plus an average at the end.

## Parallel Mode
